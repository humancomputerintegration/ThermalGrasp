# ThermalGrasp

This is a repository for the prototype ThermalGrasp devices created by Alex Mazursky, Jas Brooks, Beza Desta, and Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/). Our wearable thermal interfaces made with the ThermalGrasp approach enable users to grab and walk on real objects with minimal obstruction. For specific study details, please refer to our paper (note, it is currently undergoing peer review).
