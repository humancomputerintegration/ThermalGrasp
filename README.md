![Figure 1 has two photos labelled (a) and (b). Figure 1(a) depicts a user kneeling with their rear knee on artificial turf and their front foot on top of sand. They are wearing thermal feedback devices on their hands and feet, as well as a VR headset. The foot that is in the sand is experiencing cold sensation. One of their hands is holding a wooden dowel rod and is experiencing heat from a fire shown in VR. Figure 1(b) depicts a fabricated device that wraps around the user's hand.](/Images/Fig-01-Large.jpg?raw=true)

# ThermalGrasp

This is a repository for the prototype ThermalGrasp devices created by Alex Mazursky, Jas Brooks, Beza Desta, and Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/). Our wearable thermal interfaces made with the ThermalGrasp approach enable users to grab and walk on real objects with minimal obstruction. For specific study details, please refer to our paper.
## Repository Structure

* `Arduino` contains code for the microcontroller (Arduino Mega).
* `3D-prints` contains models for the form-fitting shells for the hands and feet (.stl files). These can be printed in regular PLA using an FDM 3D printer. Additionally includes Fusion360 assemblies (.f3d files) of the entire device (shells, peltiers, fans, copper, etc.).

## Hardware

</p>

Here are the specific hardware components used in each device instantiation and our hardware used in Study 2's backpack.

- Peltiers (foot: TEC12706, hand: CP60231H)
- Copper heat pipes (foot: 70W 11.2 x 3.5 x 100mm, hand: 60W 8.3 x 2.5 x 70mm)
- Copper sheet metal (0.2mm thick)
- Neoprene foam (3.2mm thick, easily compressible)
- Heatsinks (foot: 40 x 40 x 12mm, hand: 20 x 20 x 10mm)
- Fans (foot: 24V, 40 x 40mm, hand: 12V, 20 x 20mm)
- Temperature sensors (100kΩ NTC 3950 thermistors) 
- Motor drivers (VNH3SP30)
- Microcontroller (ATmega2560/Arduino Mega)
- MOSFET (RFP30N06LE, triggers fans)
